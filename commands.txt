NOTE: All the term below must be spoken exactly otherwise it won't recognize it. #We haven't added a lot of pattern to recognize every format or form of questions, because it would consume a lot of time. But we make it easier to add a pattern with the use of AIML module in python, the questions were separated and anyone can easily add questions and patterns to the said program with the help of this module.
